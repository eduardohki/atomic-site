An updated version of [CentOS Atomic Host](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic/Download) (tree version 7.20170428), is
now available, featuring the option of substituting the hostâ€™s default
docker 1.12 container engine with a more recent, docker 1.13-based
version, provided via the docker-latest package.

READMORE

CentOS Atomic Host is a lean operating system designed to run Docker
containers, built from standard CentOS 7 RPMs, and tracking the
component versions included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host.

CentOS Atomic Host is available as a VirtualBox or libvirt-formatted
Vagrant box, or as an installable ISO, qcow2 or Amazon Machine image.
These images are available for download at cloud.centos.org. The backing
ostree repo is published to mirror.centos.org.

CentOS Atomic Host includes these core component versions:

* atomic-1.15.4-2.el7.x86_64
* cloud-init-0.7.5-10.el7.centos.1.x86_64
* docker-1.12.6-16.el7.centos.x86_64
* etcd-3.1.3-1.el7.x86_64
* flannel-0.7.0-1.el7.x86_64
* kernel-3.10.0-514.16.1.el7.x86_64
* kubernetes-node-1.5.2-0.5.gita552679.el7.x86_64
* ostree-2017.3-2.el7.x86_64
* rpm-ostree-client-2017.3-1.atomic.el7.x86_64

## Containerized kubernetes-master

The downstream release of CentOS Atomic Host ships without the
kubernetes-master package built into the image. Instead, you can run the
master kubernetes components (apiserver, scheduler, and
controller-manager) in containers, managed via systemd, using the
[service files and instructions on the CentOS wiki](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic/ContainerizedMaster). The containers
referenced in these systemd service files are built in and hosted from
the CentOS Community Container Pipeline, based on Dockerfiles from the
CentOS-Dockerfiles repository.

These containers have been tested with the kubernetes ansible scripts
provided in the upstream contrib repository, and they work as expected,
provided you first copy the service files onto your master.

Alternatively, you can install the kubernetes-master components using
rpm-ostree package layering using the command:

```
atomic host install kubernetes-master
```

## docker-latest

You can switch to the alternate docker version by running:

```
# systemctl disable docker --now
# systemctl enable docker-latest --now
# sed -i '/DOCKERBINARY/s/^#//g' /etc/sysconfig/docker
```

Because both docker services share the `/run/docker` directory, you cannot
run both docker and docker-latest at the same time on the same system.

## Upgrading

If you're running a previous version of CentOS Atomic Host, you can
upgrade to the current image by running the following command:

```
$ sudo atomic host upgrade
```

## Images

### Vagrant

CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-Vagrant-Libvirt.box and
CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-Vagrant-Virtualbox.box are Vagrant boxes for
Libvirt and Virtualbox providers.

The easiest way to consume these images is via [the Atlas / Vagrant Cloud
setup](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/boxes/atomic-host). For
example, getting the VirtualBox instance up would involve running the
following two commands on a machine with vagrant installed:

```
$ vagrant init centos/atomic-host && vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```

### ISO

The installer ISO can be used via regular install methods (PXE, CD, USB
image, etc.) and uses the Anaconda installer to deliver the CentOS
Atomic Host. This image allows users to control the install using
kickstarts and to define custom storage, networking and user accounts.
This is the recommended option for getting CentOS Atomic Host onto bare
metal machines, or for generating your own image sets for custom
environments.

### QCOW2

The CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-GenericCloud.qcow2 image is suitable for use in
on-premise and local virtualized environments. We test this on
OpenStack, AWS and local Libvirt installs. If your virtualization
platform does not provide its own cloud-init metadata source, you can
create your own NoCloud iso image.

## Release Cycle

The CentOS Atomic Host image follows the upstream Red Hat Enterprise
Linux Atomic Host cadence. After sources are released, they're rebuilt
and included in new images. After the images are tested by the SIG and
deemed ready, we announce them.

## Getting Involved

CentOS Atomic Host is produced by the CentOS Atomic SIG, based on
upstream work from Project Atomic. If you'd like to work on testing
images, help with packaging, documentation -- join us!

The SIG meets weekly on Thursdays at 16:00 UTC in the #centos-devel
channel, and you'll often find us in #atomic and/or #centos-devel if you
have questions. You can also join the atomic-devel mailing list if you'd
like to discuss the direction of Project Atomic, its components, or have
other questions.

## Getting Help

If you run into any problems with the images or components, feel free to
ask on the centos-devel mailing list.

Have questions about using Atomic? See the atomic mailing list or find
us in the #atomic channel on Freenode.
